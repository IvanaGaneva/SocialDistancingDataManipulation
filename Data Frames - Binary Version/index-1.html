<h4 id="updates-april-onwards">Updates (April onwards):</h4>
<hr />
<h5 id="2604">26/04</h5>
<p>o Adjusted the codes to work with the additional information on the District of Columbia which was added in the last data set updates. </p>
<p>o Fixed minor issues and improved the policy_chains function.</p>
<p>o Began working on introducing the VaccineExempt dimensionality to the data (which was added this month by the authors).</p>
<p>o Improvements made on the FILL_function.</p>
<p>o Need to complete first the aux_fun_chains_START_fill.</p>
<p>o Saved all relevant data sets (up-to-date) in the Environment_uptil_EELJ_26_April.RData file for faster loading.</p>
<hr />
<h5 id="3004">30/04</h5>
<p>o Completed the aux_fun_chains_START_fill function. It fills the final data frame output (per state, per policy type) with the information on all starting policies.</p>
<p>o Improvements made on the FILL_function.</p>
<p>o Need to fix the issue with the primary and the secondary variable on the SchoolClose measure.</p>
<p>o Made an exhaustive list of heterogeneity sources.</p>
<p>o Improvements made on the EDA function.</p>
<p>o Need to adjust output for policy-state combinations so that there are the 'normal-world' values for dates before the policy chain commencements in the respective measures.</p>
<hr />
<h5 id="0505">05/05</h5>
<p>o Found an issue with the encoding of the state of Hawaii: discrepancy between Wiki/original data and the one in the data set (fixed).</p>
<p>o Improved and finalized the ENDS_EXTENDS function.</p>
<p>o Improved and finalized the EELJ function.</p>
<p>o Ran the functions on all state-policies combinations and saved the outputs in merged data frames.</p>
<p>o Saved all relevant data sets (up-to-date) in the Environment_uptil_EELJ_05_May.RData file for faster loading.</p>
<hr />
<h5 id="1105">11/05</h5>
<p>o Completed the time dimensionality in the FILL_function.</p>
<p>o Need to add remaining cases of heterogeneity, following the example set in the aux_fun_chains_START_fill function.</p>
<p>o After the completion of the FILL_function, probably need to split it into smaller chunks for brevity/clarity.</p>
<p>o Completed the introduction of the VaccineExempt dimensionality.</p>
<hr />
<h5 id="1605">16/05</h5>
<p>o Completed the FILL_function.</p>
<p>o Fixed minor issues with the functions of aux_fun_chains_START_fill, and the functions of EELJ.</p>
<p>o Re-ordered parts of the code of empty_df function in order to avoid potential issues in the future.</p>
<p>o A couple of notes on filtering in the future: potentially need to filter on end_date_obtained, and issues in the policy_chains data frame for all policies and states.</p>
<p>o Addressed the issue of uncoded policy changes, began initial work on text-mining in order to assimilate these instances: at most 15% of data is uncoded.</p>
<hr />
<h5 id="2705">27/05</h5>
<p>o Improvements made on the SchoolClose policy measure (needs to be completed), text mining, analyze and structure all possible cases.</p>
<p>o Working on the uncoded policy changes cases - improvements made where other variables give necessary information. (=&gt; &lt;15% uncoded data)</p>
<p>o Began structuring the functions within a single R project.</p>
<p>o Improvements made on the plotting function (maps/timeline of counties vs. measures over time).</p>
<p>o Found a minor issue with the coding/input of some counties in the data set (e.g. 'St Clair' vs. 'St. Clair'): need to fix this.</p>
<p>o Improvements made on the leaves &amp; joins incidences (simultaneous): this needs to be completed.</p>
<p>o Began working on the aggregation part (simpler than the county level, equivalent to filtering for SWGeo == 1 in the <em>transformed</em> output).</p>
<p>o Saved all relevant data sets (up-to-date) in the Environment_uptil_EELJ_27_May.RData file for faster loading.</p>
<hr />
<h5 id="3105">31/05</h5>
<p>o Completed the text mining process for the School Close variable.</p>
<p>o Fixed the issues with the counties' punctuation; added a couple of text-mining chunks of codes.</p>
<p>o Fixed minor issues with the main FILL_function.</p>
<p>o Saved the SchoolClose data set at the county level within the SchoolClose_COUNTY_lvl.RData file, as per request.</p>
<hr />
<h5 id="0106">01/06</h5>
<p>o Added aggregation of the SchoolClose variable at the State level, based on what fraction of the population is affected by the measures implemented at the county-level.</p>
<p>o Saved the SchoolClose data set at the state level within the SchoolClose_STATE_lvl.RData file, as per request.</p>
<p>o Some important notes for the transferring between categorical to numeric values: 
   - adopting the notion that 'NoInPerson' translates to 1 (policy being strictly implemented);
   - likewise 'LimitedInPerson' is set to equal 0.5 (this could be optimized with further text mining, somewhat arbitrary atm);
   - lastly, 'InPersonAllowed' means that the restrictive policy measure is not implemented at the time, i.e. giving it a value of 0;
   - using the official Wiki data for the counties' population as of 2019 (automatically downloaded).</p>
<p>o Saved all other relevant data sets (up-to-date) in the Environment_uptil_EELJ_1_June.RData file for faster loading.</p>
